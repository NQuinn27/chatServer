chatServer
==========

A quick try at a chat server/client setup using Sockets - as an exercise in Networking/Sockets.

Implemented using a Python Server and NSStream sockets on the iOS app.

I did this late on a friday night... cleanup and feature improvements to come...

####Usage
run server in terminal
`sudo python server.py`

open up another terminal tab, listen on port
`telnet localhost 90`

Run iOS app in simulator
